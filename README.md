Moxy-Parser
===========

Moxy-Parser is a parser written in Java. It is a rethink and redesign of what we think a parser should do. The aim is to provide multiple hooks into the parsing lifecycle and to support multiple grammars and grammar specifications and to allow us to view, optimise and debug such grammars.
